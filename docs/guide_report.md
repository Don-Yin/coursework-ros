## Report Format
Introduction (1-2 pages, 16.6% of grade). Describe why integration between imaging processing and robotic simulation is useful in the context of medical applications. Why is using: (a) image processing, (b) robot simulation useful for medical applications. Finally describe the advantages to developing an end-to-end pipeline for a clinical setting. Consider both advantages in implementation (designing the system) and validation (assessing accuracy and robustness).

Methodology (3-5 pages, 33.3% of grade). Describe in detail the components of the system (3D Slicer path planning, OpenIGTLink for data transfer from 3D Slicer to ROS, ROS implementation to move robot, OpenIGTLink for data transfer from ROS to 3D Slicer), and a detailed description of how information is transferred between components. Care should be taken to clearly explain where coordinate transformations and changes in data representation are necessary for data transfer between software components.

Validation (3-5 pages, 16.6% of grade). Describe in detail how each component was tested to validate output was correct. Finally, end to end testing to validate the entire workflow should be described. Screenshots and data visualization can be used to demonstrate results.

Discussion/Conclusion (1 page, 16.6% of grade). Briefly summarize the key conclusion for your end to end pipeline. What, if any, components would you change to improve performance and why?

Code (16.6% of grade): all python scripts used should be provide. A brief readme to explain each component and how to run the end-to-end pipeline should be provided.
